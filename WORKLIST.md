## Step 1 — Bit-rot triage (parallelizable) [x] 2026-04-23

Committed as `95f7e67`.

- [x] Track A: delete `inwebclaude.ts` / `outwebclaude.ts`
- [x] Track B: document `canvas.js` + `enhance.js` with convention headers
- [x] Track C: S7 verdict — rides with Phase 4, condition recorded in ROADMAP

## Step 2 — Phase 2 vertical slice (sequential) [x] 2026-04-23

Committed as `40473be`.

- [x] O1: `scripts/tasks/` + README (JSON-in / JSON-out convention)
- [x] O2: `aggregate-telemetry.sh` → `/opt/nest/data/telemetry-summary.json`
- [x] O6: `GET /api/observability/tokens` (auto-regenerates if >5min stale)
- [x] O10: `/observability` page (waste indicator, top paths, breakdowns)

## Step 3 — Reassess observability signal [x] 2026-04-23

**Outcome: skip O3/O4, proceed to step 4.**

Waste-pct across windows:

| Window | Total | Errors | Dupes | Waste % |
|--------|------:|-------:|------:|--------:|
| 1h     |   22  |    3   |   3   |  27.3%  |
| 6h     |   67  |   10   |   5   |  22.4%  |
| 24h    |   70  |   11   |   5   |  22.9%  |
| **7d** |  **563** | **15** | **7** | **3.9%** |

Short windows are noise-dominated by same-session probe activity. 7-day is representative.

**Waste composition (24h sample):**
- Errors: `/favicon.ico` 404 × 3 (missing asset, not retry waste) · `/api/*` 401 × 5 (unauthenticated probes) · `/` 404 × 1, `/nest` 404 × 1 (one-offs) · `/api/servers` 500 × 1 (genuine bug, file separately).
- Duplicates: all browser asset-fetch patterns (favicon, icon-192.png, manifest.webmanifest) within 74–266ms — browser parallelism, not app retries.

Nothing in the data resembles "AI-for-data-fetching waste" that O3/O4 would catch. O3 also overlaps with the existing self-knowledge `/api/nest/wiring` endpoint. Cron (O4) can be added trivially if a future signal emerges.

**Noted for later:** `/api/servers` 500 — one-off, not on the critical path, tracked here for eventual investigation.

- [x] Read waste data across windows.
- [x] Verdict: 7d waste 3.9% < 5% threshold. Skip O3/O4.

## Step 4 — Phase 3 OpenClaw (strict sequential)

- [~] C1: Docker Compose for OpenClaw — **artifacts staged, deployment blocked** `HUMAN`
  - `scripts/templates/docker-compose.openclaw.yml` (image `ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:latest`, gateway 18789, bridge 18790, data at `/opt/nest/data/openclaw`)
  - `scripts/appendages/install-openclaw.sh`
  - Compose config validates cleanly.
  - **Blocker:** server is IPv6-only (no default IPv4 route). `ghcr.io` has no AAAA records and no NAT64/DNS64 is configured. Pull fails with "network is unreachable". Resolve via one of: enable IPv4 in Hetzner Cloud Console, configure Hetzner DNS64 (`2a01:4ff:ff00::add:1`), or configure an HTTP(S) registry proxy. Once routable, run `scripts/appendages/install-openclaw.sh`.
- [ ] C2: Codex OAuth onboarding `HUMAN` (requires browser, also blocked until C1 deploys)
- [ ] C3: WebChat channel + gateway token auth
- [ ] C10: telemetry bridge — pipe `~/.openclaw/logs/telemetry.jsonl` into O2 aggregator (Phase 2↔3 seam, must land right after C3 so token data stays unified)
- [ ] C4: Caddyfile route `/claw/` → OpenClaw WebChat port
- [ ] C9: replace `hub/src/routes/chat.js` keyword stub with WebChat proxy
- [ ] C5: `server-overview` skill — first real skill, proves the pattern
- [ ] `REASSESS` end-of-phase checkpoint

## Step 5 — Phase 3 skill fan-out (parallelizable after C5)

Dispatch C6/C7/C8 as three subagents in parallel **only after** C5 proves the pattern.

- [ ] C6: `container-manager` skill
- [ ] C7: `script-runner` skill
- [ ] C8: `token-report` skill

## Step 6+ — Menu (not active)

Selection happens after step 5 completes.

- Phase 4 (age encryption): E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7
- Phase 5 (appendages): A1–A9
- Phase 6 (client): U4–U9
- Phase 7 (infra): I1–I8
- Phase 8 (Dockbase): D1–D5
